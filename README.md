# Developer Blog

## Description

This is a full stack project which has been built from scratch to allow users to create their own blogs. We have combined back end and front end processes to provide a system whereby users can login, see their dashboard with a personlised welcome sign. This allows them to create, edit and delete blog posts. We have also allowed any registered and logged in user to be able to leave comments on blog posts.
